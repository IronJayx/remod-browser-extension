## Project
- My idea behind Remod is to make the web more engaging. 
- I believe we can do so by making it more modular, letting anyone add contributions (code, text, designs...) to any web pages and share them with the other participants of the network. 
- This would effectively create a "community-run web over the web" composed of alternative "mods" that Remod-members have created and vetted over specific web pages. 

## Current version
Remod's current version consists of a browser extension that lets you inject comments in any web pages and share it with the rest of the network. When another Remod user loads the web page he will be able to see and react to your comments. 

## See what's up
You can a list of other users activity here -> http://13.38.128.167:5000/


## How to use it
The extension is accessible on the Chrome web store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remod/hpgmkopbheglhcbjncbilkfijdnjbbod


Notes: 
- This is an experimental project I am currently developing on my free time. Any contribution or feedback is welcome. 
- The extension only works on chrome for now.
